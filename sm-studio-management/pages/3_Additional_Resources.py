    * A Studio domain is a logical aggregation of an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume, a list of users authorized to access the domain, and configurations related to security, application, networking, and more. A domain promotes collaboration between users where they can share notebooks and other artifacts with other users in the same domain.

* Each user added to the Studio domain is represented by a user profile. This profile contains unique information about the user with in the domain, like the execution role for the user, the Posix user ID of the userâ€™s profile in the Amazon EFS volume, and more.

* An app is an application running for a user in the domain, implemented as a Docker container.

### _Cost tracking with tags_

* SageMaker Studio automatically tags resources such as training jobs, processing jobs, experiments, pipelines, and model registry entries with their respective sagemaker:domain-arn. 
* SageMaker also tags the resource with the sagemaker:user-profile-arn or sagemaker:space-arn to designate the resource creation at an even more granular level.
* Similar to other AWS resources, you can use automated tagging to monitor costs by using tools such as AWS Budgets and AWS Cost Explorer.
